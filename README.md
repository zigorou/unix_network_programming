Studying UNIX Network Programming for me
========================================

This repository is studying UNIX Network Programming for me.
Sample codes are coming from http://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4894712059/.

But I tried to rewrite codes. Because original source codes depend on all-in-one header called "unp.h".
I hate such a style, so I don't understand idiom for UNIX network programming.
